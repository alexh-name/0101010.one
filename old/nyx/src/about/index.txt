nyx is what I make out of the meta-Linux-distribution Gentoo.
It aims to get as suckless as possible, step by step, thus taking some kind of top-down approach to a suckless Linux distribution.
I'm constantly working on making it available to everyone and it shouldn't be taking much longer.
You can follow my progress in this blog and on my git-repo [1].

Also, I document everyday changes and progress here, as well as things that might be of interest for Gentoo- / Linux-users in general.
