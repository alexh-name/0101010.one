: nice video playback with adobe flash (update)

It appears that, in the new version (11.2.202.378) something's changed, so that

====
EnableLinuxHWVideoDecode = 1
====
leads to no advantage, but horribly unstable playback (radeon hd5700, mesa 8.1.0). Removing it, only leaving

====
OverrideGPUValidation = 1
====

is fine, giving the nice smooth & tearingless playback as before, also now without inverted colors.
