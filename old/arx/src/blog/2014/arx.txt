: talking about arx

Today I decided to finally talk about another project, arx. 
Arx is a modified nyx [1], to run on Raspberry Pis and to allow them to function as as what a WiFi router would usually do, but with it's configuration and features only limited by your own means. 
This includes:

* dialing up your DSL connection through an external modem or per pppoe/pppoa through another router
* serving as a powerfull and highly customizable firewall with every routing capability you'll probably need, thanks to iptables
* serving as DNS server through dnsmasq (which allows central adblocking for your entire network)
* serving as NTP time server, to sync all your network connected devices accurately and efficiently
* using DDNS to reach your home network by domain names through the web
* SSH login and a complete linux environment at your hand
* customizable logging with metalog and automatic reports per mail

But it can do much more. Right now, my RPi does/runs:

* prioritize and split upload bandwith by any criteria you can define with iptables (same with download bandwith is in work)
* multiple OpenVPN servers
* a umurmurd instance
* a TOR relay
* multiple polipo webcaches
* a thttp webserver
* a mailserver for the intranet
* and multiple hostapd WiFi APs

I often see how people underestimate what can be done with a small, cheap and in comparison low-end device like the RPi. I'm running the model B and I'm barely using a big fraction of the processing power in usual cases. I even compile the whole system on the Pi. While I probably wouldn't recommend that on a model A, running arx on it wouldn't be a problem at all. 
It's also a fully functional Gentoo Linux, ready to customize the hell out of it.
