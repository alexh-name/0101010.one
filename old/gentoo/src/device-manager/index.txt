: device manager

:: 2014.06.17: mdev and glibc 2.19

Nyx currently uses busybox's mdev as device manager. With the update to glibc 2.19, it was not possible to build a binary compatible with glibc's user/groups mechanisms. Mdev couldn't recognize any user or group whatsoever. 
Fortunately, busybox can have it's own internal mechanism for that.
