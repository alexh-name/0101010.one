:: hyperrealm.com (libconfig) for insecure sources download

Yes, this seems to be very common, but I have to start somewhere. 
The authors of libconfig are promoting an insecure sources download via http without providing checksums. As there isn't any contact info I could find in a reasonable amount of time, I'm posting this here right away.

There is a repo on github [1]. Unfortunately it lacks some files to build. As a workaround I added those from the tarball on their homepage to a fork of v1.5: [2]
