:: insecure sources and/or binary distribution

Yes, this seems to be very common, but I have to start somewhere. 
Sources or binaries are too often offered by insecure download via http without providing checksums.

::: hyperrealm.com (libconfig)

Right here: [4]

As there isn't any contact info I could find in a reasonable amount of time, I'm posting this here right away.

:::: alternatives

There is a repo on github [1].

<del>Unfortunately it lacks some files to build. As a workaround I added those from the tarball on their homepage</del>

They now added the missing files to build it [3]. I applied the commit to a fork of v1.5: [2]
