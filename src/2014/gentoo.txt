: splitting pages nyx and gentoo

I'm getting more serious with my project nyx. While I wanted to use the nyx-subpage more for tutorials unique to nyx, documentations on how I changed and implemented things in gentoo to become part of nyx didn't quite fit there anymore. 
This is why this kind of stuff gets it's own place from now on, which is there [1].
