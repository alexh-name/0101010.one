:: 500 police people raiding one building

On 2016/01/14 around noon a police person giving a ticket for wrong parking has been attacked by four individuals. Claims are they went into the 'Rigaer 94' after the attack. The raid happened in the evening of that same day. [1] [2]

::: Why is this insane?

* it apparently happened out of revenge
* a spokesperson said that they didn't expect any of the four individuals to be there any more [5]
* the reason was said to be the seizure of dangerous objects
* what they seized were: stones, crow's feet, weights, fire extinguishers, poles
* people responsible for inner security claim they lack police forces
* they managed to come up with 500 people in a matter of hours for such a thing
* they used special forces (SEK)
* they also had several helicopters
they clearly exaggerated
* they weren't finished before midnight
* they then moved to another close building claiming the music there was too loud
* obviously the 500 people and the helicopters weren't very quiet themselves
* residents of a huge part of the street weren't allowed to move inside their homes
* in all of 2015 there was a massive rise of attacks against shelters for refugees including life threatening ones like arsons without any comparable reaction [6]
