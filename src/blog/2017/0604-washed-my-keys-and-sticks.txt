: thumb drives can be quite resilient

Yesterday I managed to throw my keyring into the washing machine and only
realized the loud noise it was making after about 30mins.  
This included 2x Kingston DataTraveler USB 3 and a USB 2 model as well as my
YubiKey 4. I let the YubiKey dry for 2 hours or so, the thumb drives for 24h.
They all still work :)
