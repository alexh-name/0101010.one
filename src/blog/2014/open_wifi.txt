: 2014.05.23: open WiFi back online

My open WiFi with TOR-access is back and available. 
The downtime was due to my change to another ISP. I ditched the new ISP's router and wanted to replace it by a new adapter for my RPi based own router. Unfortunately I received a revision that has troubles to function as access point.

For now, the open WiFi is powered by the same adapter as before, until I sorted out the problems. The new adapter should have a much stronger signal.
