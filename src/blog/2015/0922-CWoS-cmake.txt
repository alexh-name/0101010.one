: Short update on the Crypto Wall of Shame

So far out of three complains I made, two were answered. 
A hosting company rewrote a tutorial and hyperrealm (folks behind libconfig) are providing
ready-to-build sources over github. Unfortunatly, they are still promoting a http-download
of the sources on their homepage - without checksums.

Kitware (folks behind cmake) didn't respond at all. They are providing sources via github,
also via http-download on their server, including binaries - all without checksums.
