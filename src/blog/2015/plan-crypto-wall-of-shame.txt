: I plan to start a crypto wall of shame

While I wrote my small guide to harden radicales crypto [0], I found another guide by a hosting company that suggests to completely disable the crypto, to leave their users' contacts and appointments to be read by everyone. 
Since I believe that it is a lost case trying to educate others to use good crypto, when there are as many bad guides in the wild as I occasionally stumble upon, I decided to start a wall of shame for bad crypto advice. Whenever I find bad advice, I contact the authors and give them 4 weeks to correct it. Otherwise they'll find themselves on my wall of shame. 
 
Today I wrote the first email. I will let you know how this developed.
