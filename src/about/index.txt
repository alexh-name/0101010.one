:: Why "Cosmofox"?

Why not?

:: What is this?

Some kind of tech related blog or open notebook.

:: What about?

Whatever I stumble upon / find out / try out and want to share and / or
want to look up later on.

:: Are you stuck in the 90s? (aka your design sucks / y no JS yo?)

I think that designs suck when they need JS, databases and a CMS or framework
with hundreds of thousands of lines of code just to display some text on the web [1].
Duh.
Not to speak about the security implications.

This site is generated with ahrf [2] and wswsh [3] and some of my own
additions [4] [5]. What you see is a bunch of static plaintext files and that
should be all you need for this kind of thing.
No JS.

When my design sucks, it's not the fault of those tools. Of course you can
create awesome designs with just HTML and CSS. Check out Ypnose's website [6],
he is the original creator of those tools.

But: It is simple, functional, hackable, secure, fast and (as far as I can tell)
accessible, which is more important anyway.
