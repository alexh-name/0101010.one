/'Cause it all already sucks enough/

:: What is this?

Some kind of tech related blog or open notebook. 
The txt-files are in a github-repo, so feel encouraged to contribute. [0]

:: What about?

Whatever I stumble upon / find out / try out and want to share and / or
want to look up later on.

:: What else?

This site is generated with ahrf [2] and wswsh [3] and some of my own
additions [4] [5]. What you see is a bunch of static plaintext files and that
should be all you need for this kind of thing.

Check out Ypnose's website [6],
he is the original creator of those tools.

No JS. I don't like to use it for design and layout.

I try to keep this as accessible as possible, feel free to give me a hint where it isn't.
