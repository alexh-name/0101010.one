: open WiFi now with TOR-routing again

I updated [0], as a new law in Germany passed, that will loosen the liable resposibility for commercial runners of open WiFis, simultaneously saying 'private runners will be liable'.
Sadly, this is why I have to route everything through TOR again, so I won't get into trouble for what a neighbour might do.
