: video playback

:: 2014.06.17: nice video playback with adobe flash

::: Flash-videos without lagging and tearing :::

Videos in flash never worked great before. That's why I was really glad when solutions came up playing videos on Youtube et al. on native media players. 
Still, this isn't always a possibility and it bothered me. 
So I digged into comptons documentation again and found a combination of configuration flags that work out very well now (on mesa open source driver + hd5700) when enabling hardware acceleration in adobe flash. 
No tearing, smooth fps. 
Unfortunatly, having vdpau features installed lead to flash trying to use it, horribly messing up the colors. 
Apparently, adding

====
OverrideGPUValidation = 1

and checking the box 'Enable hardware acceleration' in the right-click-window of flash-videos, submenu 'Settings...' makes the difference. 
I do not know why and I don't bother. Flash needs to die already. But until then: nice video playback finally.
