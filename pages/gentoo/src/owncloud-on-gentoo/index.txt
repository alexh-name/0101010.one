: owncloud on gentoo

Needed packages:

====
www-apps/owncloud
www-servers/lighttpd
dev-lang/php
====

Create /etc/portage/package.use/owncloud with:

====
# required by virtual/httpd-php-5.5
# required by www-apps/owncloud-7.0.1
=dev-lang/php-5.5.16:5.5 curl fpm hash xmlwriter simplexml pdo json sqlite gd zip filter
 
# required by dev-lang/php-5.5.16
# required by www-apps/owncloud-7.0.1
=app-admin/eselect-php-0.7.1-r3 fpm
 
dev-lang/php iconv bzip2 crypt exif fileinfo session
www-servers/lighttpd -php pcre
====

Start with installing app-admin/webapp-config and www-servers/lighttpd:

====
emerge -av1 app-admin/webapp-config && emerge -av www-servers/lighttpd
====

In '/etc/vhosts/webapp-config' replace:

====
vhost_server="apache"
====

with:

====
vhost_server="lighttpd"
====

Continue to install the rest:

====
emerge -avuN www-apps/owncloud dev-lang/php
====

In '/etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf' uncomment:

====
include "mod_fastcgi.conf"
====

and create '/etc/lighttpd/mod_fastcgi.conf' with this content:

====
server.modules += ("mod_fastcgi")
fastcgi.server = ( ".php" =>
  ( "localhost" =>
    (
      "host" => "127.0.0.1",
      "port" => "9000"
    )
  )
)
====

so that lighttpd actually executes some php.

Also in '/etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf' add:

====
$HTTP["url"] =~ "^/owncloud/data/" {
        url.access-deny = ("")
}
$HTTP["url"] =~ "^/owncloud($|/)" {
        dir-listing.activate = "disable"
}
====

as suggested in the owncloud documentation to make sensible data unreadable.

In '/etc/php/fpm-php*/php-fpm.conf' uncomment:

====
; Unix user/group of processes
; Note: The user is mandatory. If the group is not set, the default user's group
;       will be used.
user = lighttpd
group = lighttpd
====

so that php code is executed with the permissions of our web server.

To make sure that everything in the owncloud folder belongs to our webserver:

====
chown -R lighttpd:lighttpd /var/www/localhost/htdocs/owncloud
====

Finally start up our new services:

====
/etc/init.d/php-fpm start
/etc/init.d/lighttpd start
====

and if they shall be started at bootup:

====
rc-update add php-fpm
rc-update add lighttpd
====

<p>Now go and visit your servers subdirectory 'owncloud' with your browser and see if everything's fine.</p>
