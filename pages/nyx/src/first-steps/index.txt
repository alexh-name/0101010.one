: first steps

:: secure root

As the default root password is available online, we'll need to change it.
For the first login, you need to use:

====
user: nyx
pw: actumagere
====

since it's not allowed to directly log in as root on nyx.
You can now log into root:

====
su -
pw: arslongavitabrevis
====

and set a unique password for root:

====
passwd
====


:: secure user

::: add new unique user :::

This is important as someone could use the online available pair of username and password otherwise. First we need to create another user.

Still logged in as root, you can now create a unique user:

====
useradd -m -G users,wheel,audio,video,cron -s /bin/mksh NAME
passwd
====

Having a user in the group "wheel" is very important, otherwise you won't be able to gain root access.

::: remove the default user :::

First log out. First from root, than from the default user:

====
exit
exit
====

Try to login as your unique user now. Did it work?
Now log in again as root (remember too use the new password you've given earlier). Only root can remove a user:

====
su -
userdel -r nyx
====

Well done.
