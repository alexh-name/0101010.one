:: Flash-videos without lagging and tearing

Videos in flash never worked great before. That's why I was really glad when solutions came up playing videos on Youtube et al. on native media players. 
Still, this isn't always a possibility and it bothered me. 
So I digged into comptons documentation again and found a combination of configuration flags that work out very well now (on mesa open source driver + hd5700) when enabling hardware acceleration in adobe flash. 
No tearing, smooth fps. 
Unfortunatly, having vdpau features installed lead to flash trying to use it, horribly messing up the colors. 
Apparently, adding

====
EnableLinuxHWVideoDecode = 1
OverrideGPUValidation = 1
====

makes the difference. 
I do not know why and I don't bother. Flash needs to die already. But until then: nice video playback finally.

:: Smooth resizing of all applications in dwm

Another problem was how horrible some applications got along with having their window resized in dwm's floating mode. E.g. libreoffice is actually unusable with it. 
I was able to find a nice patch in the archive of suckless' mailing list that changes dwm, so windows get redrawn only after the new dimensions are set, not constantly while resizing the rectangle with the mouse.
