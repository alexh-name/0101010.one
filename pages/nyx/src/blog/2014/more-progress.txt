: No tearing at all, surf stable again, webGL in firefox

1. Tearing is gone, finally! As earlier mentioned, I dealt with it when playing youtube-videos with flashplayer, and native programs haven't been a problem for some longer time. Dropping a few options for compton is giving nice tearingless playback regardless of used player. 
2. Surf's segfaults are gone. I finally looked a bit closer into the issue and found out that it was a problem in libcairo. Apparently versions after 1.10 need to be build with xcb and xlib-xcb to play nicely with surf. 
3. Another segfault is gone. Thunderbird and firefox threw in a segfault in libdrm at startup without crashing for quite some time. As it seems, that was the reason for firefox refusing to have webGL-support. I'm still not sure about the exact reason for the segfaults. I switched my system back to glibc-2.17 and recompiled everything with GCC (thus switching from clang). Time might show.
