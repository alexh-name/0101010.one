: using ahrf

Ypnose [1] finished his ascii file format + interpreter called ahrf [2]. 
The interpreter is a very simple and elegant awk script, which makes it utterly easy to customize, and the file format is a pleasure to write, edit and read. 
I switched my whole website from using self written html to ahrf - thus converting every single post so far - and it was really worth it. Having a simple, straight ahead human readable ascii of your posts and having them converted into shiny html for the web is just a very nice thing.

Putting out new posts will be much easier and fun now.
