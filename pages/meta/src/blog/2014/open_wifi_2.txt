: 2014.06.08: open WiFi now without TOR-routing

A German court decided the liable resposibility for connection owners obsolete! 
I'm now able to provide up to 50mbit down / 10mbit up for anyone near my flat, as I don't have to route everything through TOR. 
I will provide another AP with TOR-routig anyways as soon as possible.
